# pi.emulators
Set of Raspberry PI hardware emulators (mostly GPIO related) to use with development and testing on laptop instead of RPI directly

Currently available following emulators:
* RPi.GPIO 
  - you can monitor GPIO pin statuses in RPi/pins.json file, which will be automatically created on the first use
* Adafruit_DHT
  - the temperature and humidity are randomly generated in the range from 0-40Â°C and 5-100%
